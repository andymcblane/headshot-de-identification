# headshot-de-identification
De-identification of images containing a human face &amp; eye(s) by detecting a (single) face in an image, detecting eyes and drawing black boxes over the eyes. 

The images used are from thispersondoesnotexist.com - while these images are **not** of real people, it is an easy way for me to get a lot of images with faces, eyes etc. Good enough for now. 

# Todo
* Improve eyes behind glasses detection
* Implement side-on photos
* Implement Docker
* Implement React front end.
* Config file

# Example - not a real person
